Hi, I'm Weiyue: a junior double majoring in Data Science and Applied Math. I'm originally from Shenzhen, China. DSC80 is one of the most useful courses in the lower-division that covers many techniques that you can use in your research and internships, and I'm thrilled to explore these topics with you! Fun fact: I am a Bears fan🐻⬇️.
